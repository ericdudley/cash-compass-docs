# v0.1.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Welcome to the first beta release of Cash Compass! In this release, we are focusing on setting foundational features of the app to support initial onboarding of users. Once we have a solid foundation, we will be able to build out more advanced features and functionality.

Given this was the first planned release, we were unsure of how much we could accomplish, turns out we over-planned a bit, partially due to the holidays. We will continuously improve on our planning and execution as we move forward to make sure our users know what we're working on and when enhancements/fixes are going to land.

## Enhancements

### Completed

- [**Email subscription management**](https://github.com/ericdudley/cash-compass-docs/issues/5) - Users can now manage their email subscription preferences from the `Account -> Manage emails` page. Likewise, any emails sent from Cash Compass will include an `Unsubscribe` link in the footer. Note, emails relating to account management and billing will always be sent.
- [**Public incident and status page**](https://github.com/ericdudley/cash-compass-docs/issues/9) - We have added a [Status](https://status.cashcompass.co) page to provide users with real-time updates on the status of the Cash Compass app and docs website. This page is also available from the footer of every page. Although we aren't planning on having any incidents, any updates on active incidents will be posted here.

### Pushed to next release

The following enhancements were planned for this release but have been pushed to the next release.

- [**Updated documentation site**](https://github.com/ericdudley/cash-compass-docs/issues/8) - Due to the holidays, we were unable to complete the user onboarding flow in time for this release. We will be working on this for the next release.
