### Expenses

At Cash Compass, one of our core philosophies is that you should build a habit of tracking your expenses instead of setting up automated systems to do it for you. As such, we've built our expense tracking feature around making it as quick and easy as possible to input your expenses. Here are some tips for getting started:

1. **Input transactions as you make them**, our tools are designed with this in mind. If you can't do this, we recommend [setting up transaction notifications](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/how-to-set-up-mobile-credit-card-alerts-fraud/) in your various credit cards and bank accounts, this will help you remember to input your transactions later.
2. **Enable Daily Reminder emails** in your [Email Settings](https://cashcompass.co/profile/account/emails) to help you remember to input any transactions you missed, on a daily basis.
3. **Create meaningful categories** that you want to group/filter your expenses by. For example, you might want to create a category for "Groceries" and "Restaurants" instead of just "Food".
4. **Check in on the [Insights](https://cashcompass.co/app/transactions/insights)** page to see how your spending is trending over time. By default it will show you insights for the current month, but you can change the date range to see how your spending has changed over the last three months, year, or whatever time period you want.

### Accounts

Cash Compass believes that you should have a holistic view of your finances, including your bank and investment accounts. We also believe that you should regularly record your account balances manually, this achieves a few goals.

1. It helps you build a habit of checking in on your finances.
2. It ensures that you are regularly accessing your online accounts, which helps you identify any potential fraud or log in issues.
3. It builds trust in our insights, since you know exactly what data was inputted and when.

Now let's get into some initial recommendations for getting started with accounts:

1. **Set up only the accounts that you want to track over time**. For example, you might want to track your savings, investment, and retirement accounts, but it might not make sense to track your checking account or credit cards.
2. **Update your account balances on a regular basis**. We recommend doing this once a month, but you can do it as often as you like.
3. **Bookmark the links to all of your financial accounts** in your browser, this will make it easier to go through them when it's time to update your account balances.

### Financial Tools

Cash Compass offers a variety of financial tools to help you with your personal finance needs. These tools cover topics like:

1. Portfolio re-balancing
2. 401k contribution calculations (coming soon)
3. FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) calculations (coming soon)

Unlike other tools you'll find online, with a Gold subscription, your data will be saved. This makes it easy to come back and update your inputs over time. We recommend you to check out what tools are available under the "Tools" menu in the navigation bar.
