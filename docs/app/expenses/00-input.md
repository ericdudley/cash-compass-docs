### Historical recommendations

As you fill out the form, you'll notice text appear under each of the fields. This is data from a transaction you've previously entered that our AI thinks is closest to what you're entering. As you fill out more fields, the recommendations will become more accurate. If you click on the text, it will fill out the field with the data from the transaction.

The recommendations are based on the following fields:
- Amount
- Description
- Day of week
- Day of month
- Category

### Creating with voice input

1. Open the Expenses menu in the top navigation bar and click on the `New Transaction` link.
   - If you're on mobile, you can also click on the `+` icon in the bottom center of the screen.
2. Click on the red circle record button iat the top of the form.
3. Say a phrase describing your transaction, such as `I spent $3.50 at my favorite coffee shop`.
3. Click the same button which is now a square stop button.
4. After a few seconds, the form will be filled out with the data from your voice input.

Key notes:
1. The voice input will try to parse out the amount, description, and category from your phrase. If the transaction was on a different day, you must change the date field.
2. You can also say things like `I split a $42.49 restaurant bill with my three friends` and it will know to divide the amount by 4 and fill out the description with `Split restaurant bill with friends`.

#### Example

If you go to a coffee shop every morning and buy a coffee for $3.50, you'll notice that after you type in the `Amount` field, the `Category` field will show `Coffee` and the `Description` field will show `My Favorite Coffee Shop`. If you click on the text, it will fill out the field with the data from the transaction.
