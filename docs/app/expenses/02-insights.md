### Customizing Your View
- **Date Range Selection**: By default, the insights display transactions from the current month. You can modify this to any desired time period using the date range selector.
- **Device Compatibility**: Note that while the insights page is accessible on both mobile and desktop, the presentation format differs. We recommend using a desktop for a more detailed view, though the mobile version is optimized for accessibility and convenience.

### Understanding Your Expenses

- **Category Breakdown**: A pie chart illustrates the proportion of spending in each category within your chosen date range, offering a visual representation of your spending distribution.

### Detailed Monthly Analysis
- **Monthly Breakdown**: A bar chart shows total expenditures for each month within your selected time frame, making it easy to spot trends or unusual spending patterns.
- **Category + Month Breakdown**: This detailed table breaks down expenses by category for each month. It's particularly useful for tracking how spending in specific areas changes over time.

### Mobile Visualization
- On mobile devices, the data is presented in an intuitive format using cards and tables. Our aim is to maintain consistency with the desktop version while ensuring optimal usability on mobile devices.
