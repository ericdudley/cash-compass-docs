## Adding a balance update to an existing Account

There are two ways to add a balance update to an existing Account:

1. From the Account detail page (single Account update)
2. From the Update Balances page (multiple Accounts update)

### From the Account detail page

1. Open the Accounts menu in the top navigation bar and click on the `All Accounts` link.
2. Click on the Account you want to update.
3. Update the `Updated Balance` field with the new balance. Below the field is the last updated date and balance.
4. Click the `Update` button.

### From the Update Balances page

1. Open the Accounts menu in the top navigation bar and click on the `Update Balances` link.
2. Update the balance field for each Account you want to update. Below the field is the last updated date and balance. This is a great way to update multiple Accounts at once without having to navigate to each Account detail page.

Accounts marked as `Closed` will not be included in the list of Accounts on the Update Balances page.
